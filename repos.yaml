# This file contains the contact information for repositories exposed through
# the Helm Hub. Each repository has a url, the base path to its location, and
# one or more maintainers.
#
# The structure of the repositories object is:
# repositories:
#  - url: https://example.com
#    maintainers:
#      - name: foo
#        email: foo@example.com
#
# Note, for the email address it is acceptable to have a mailing list for a team
# because projects often have multiple people who may rotate.
